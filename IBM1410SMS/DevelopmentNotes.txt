This file contains development notes taken as I went along.

1/24/2018 - Started development in earnest.  MySQLFramework had already been developed
earlier, as had main form.  Created a form for adding a new machine, and shuffled around
code for SQL until it ended up where I think I want it.

1/26/2018 - Modified table machine and table counter.  Updated macihine.cs in Entities, and
brought in table idcounter (which I will need when creating any entity in the application). 
Changed SQLToEntity.pl script to add a namespace parameter, and also had it output a 
using MySQLFramework statement to avoid having to do a whole bunch of casts.  
Created a class IdCounter to handle getting and incrementing the counter.
Created first test machine name and counter incremented successfully.

1/27/2018 - Added check to see if machine already exists before adding.  Added form 
and code to remove a machine.  Added a form to add a new volume set.

1/28/2018 - Renamed set table to volumeSet to avoid conflict with C# type "Set".

1/30/2018 - Added ' to column names in MySQLFramework because there were conflicts
between column names and SQL keywords (e.g. "set").  Decided to put in checks for
referential integrity during removes instead of just issuing a warning.  Finished
VolumeSet add and remove, and added add Volume form.  Added page, feature and eco
tables into entities.  Besides that, some message cleanups and other small fixes.

1/30/2018 - Had to run an SVN cleanup: TortoiseSVN Cleanup..., Select copy status,
break locks, fix time stamps, vacuum pristing copies, refresh shell overlays, 
include externals.

1/31/2018 - Added a check for volume references when removing a volume set, and tested. 
Brought in the cardtype entity, which has a reference to volume.  Had to change the 
type for dates from "DATE" to DateTime to keep C# happy.  Added remove volume form and
associated menu entry.  Removed unused connection object instance from main form, and
removed the using MySQLFrameworks statement.  Tested remove volume.

2/1/2018 - Started working on form to edit features.  Settled on using DataGridView
control.  Got machine selection and display working.

2/2/2018 - Continued to work on form to edit features.  Brought in referenced tables
(cardlocation, diagramblock).  Added a modified field to the database entity objects,
so I can mark them as the users changes them in the DataGridView.  Learned how to handle
deletes.  Adds were easy (when all done, those are the ones with no existing feature
code.)   This should be much easier for other places I will use a table to edit!

2/3/2018 - Tested edit features.  Liked it so much I decided to change all of the 
removes to update/removes, and changed removeVolume to use a data grid view like 
features (for a particular volume set).  Along the way fixed a bug in the MySQLFramework -
it was not quoting column names during an update.  

2/3/2018 - Changed form that had just been machine removal to add update capability. 
Also added check for frame references to machine, which had been overlooked.

2/3/2018 - Added Edit form for Frames and tested.  Patterned after Features, but
more simple - only one column is involved.  Brought in frame, machinegate and (by
accident) gatepin tables.  

2/4/2018 - Added form for Machine Gates and tested.  This one had two pull down lists,
so there was more code.  Also, decided on this one to just reset, and leave the form
up after an apply, so another gate could be selected.

2/5/2018 - Started work on panels.  Decided to integrate card slots into that, using
pull-down lists in the datagridview.  Started but not nearly finished.  Will need to
add checks for references to cardslot from tiedown, diagramblock and edgeconnector as
well as cardlocation.  Also still have to solve the issue of having to click multiple
times on the pulldowns inside the datagridview, and how to synchronize changes (perhaps
using the index.)

2/6/2018 - Worked on form for editing panels.  Had several false starts, first trying 
to create unbound combo box columns in the data grid view, and then unbound text box 
columns.  I could never get them to update right.  So instead I created an internal 
type I can initialize from the database and use to update the database. Viewing is 
pretty much in place, but I need to work on the widths and the add / remove / update 
logic.

2/7/2018 - Minimal progress on editing panels.

2/8/2018 - More progress on editing panels.  Have the panel validation event working,
all that is left are the apply button activities.

2/9/2018 - More (slow) progress on editing panels.  Apply button requires lots of 
checks and manipulations of the cardslot table, in progress.

2/10/2018 - Finished editing panel form and tested.  (Whew).  Got started on ECO
edit form a little bit.

2/11/2018 - Worked on a bit more consistency in field max lengths and field editing.
Finished ECO editing form.

2/12/2018 - Started work on CardLocationPage form.  Form layout, began coding.

2/13/2018 - Continued work on CardLocationPage form.  Most of the combo boxes
working as desired, but need to do some more testing.  Then on to filling in
data / editing / update / add.

2/15/2018 - Continued work on CardLocatinPage form.

2/16/2018 - Nearly done with CardLocationPage form.  Learned about that setting
a ComboBox.SelectedItem one has to use the orignal item, not one that is the same
(it uses Object.Equals).  Also learned that two combo boxes built from the same list
will track each other unless you use a new BindingContext for the 2nd and any
additional combo boxes.  Mostly working, but a few things to clean up.

2/17/2018 - Cleaned up some things on the CardLocationPage form.  Added comments.
Fixed bug where ECO combo boxes did not refresh after adding a new ECO.  Now
we clear the page after any add, update/apply or remove as well.

2/27/2018 - Spent a lot of time house cleaning in prep for some house guests.
Finally got back to this.  Added ibmlogicfunction and cardgate tables.  Added
form for editing IBM Logic Functions.  Also fixed missing cacnel in editing of
ECOs.

2/27/2018 - Came across a small issue.  If a user is editing the last row or 
clicks in the add, but then doesn't do anything, those forms that have 
cell validation become unhappy with the empty column (of what is really an
empty row.)  This can be fixed by checking DGV.Rows[e.RowIndex].IsNewRow and
just returning when it is indeed new.  (Fixed in ECOs, Features, Frames,
Machine Gates and Volumes on 2/28.  Interestingly, this code was already 
in place in Panels - I had to re-learn it, apparently).

2/28/2018 - Added logicfunction table.  Deleted dead code in IBM Logic
Function form.  Added (Standard) Logic Function Form and tested.

2/28/2018 - Added missing Tool Tips to data grids for ECOs, Logic Functions,
Panels, Card Locations, Features, Frames, IBM Logic Functions and Volumes.

2/28/2018 - Added logicfamily table.

3/1/2018 - Added Logic Levels Table and Form and tested.  
Also, changed database definition to say that these voltages are in tenths 
(rather than integer volts or using floating point in the database).  Went
back and performed overlooked tests on referential integrity when removing
rows from (IBM) Logic Family, IBM Logic Function and Standard Logic Function
tables.

3/1/2018 - MILESTONE.  The simpler single-table and two-table edits are done.
The harder multi-table, complicated edits are what remains.  In looking, I 
discovered a small issue.  The cardLocationBlock table refers to a cell in
a diagram page as "block" - a single field, whereas the diagramBlock table
identifies a Row(2 chars) and column (int) for the same kind of thing.  Need
to reconcile that.

3/2/2018 - Added Card note table to start working on Card Type (SMS Card) Form.
Layed out Card Type form, including ECOs and Notes.  Increased length of Logic
Family table name field to 16 to accommodate "CONVERTER".  Changed some names
in the Card Type table to more accurately reflect their usage.

3/3/2018 - Continued work on Card Type form.  Completed form fill-in.  Working
on validation.

3/4/2018 - Continued work on Card Type form, which is pretty complicated, in part
because the card ECO table does not have the name of the ECO, just its database
key, and because the user might make considerable changes to the notes, which
are often referred to by the Card ECOs.

3/5/2018 - Initial coding of Edit Card Types Form complete, initial testing started.
Ran into a BIG problem with ECOs, where I display and update data that is not
actually in the original list (text version of ECO key and note key).  Have a 
solution of using a subclass that has the added data, but still have to work
out the details.

3/6/2018 - After a lot of work, managed to get ECOs to display correctly using a
subclass.  Also used auto width so that the data grid view columns fill out the
control - will maybe go back and fix that in the other data grid views as well.
Tested.  One idiosyncrasy exists:  if the user renames a note (not the note text,
but its named identifier) and does not ALSO change the note name column in the
ECOs, then the old note does get renamed, but the update will then auto-add an
entry with the old note name.  I decided this was better than trying to update
the ECO list "magically".

3/6/2018 - Updated gatePin table to specify voltage in tenths, and edited comments
to better explain pin vs. inputGate/outputGate.  Started work on Card Gates 
editing form.  Using unbound data grid view for this one - it consists of a
check box (for delete), text boxes and drop down combo boxes.  Initially, so far,
so good.

3/7/2018 - Working on Card Gates editing form.  Struggling with combo boxes in datagrid -
getting the value is complicated and esoteric.  Need to decide if I want to change the
approach.

3/8/2018 - Changed things up to use data sources for the combo boxes that represent
child tables.  Coding completed, but only partly tested.  Re-generated cardgate table
entity - it was old, and still had a "bool" data type inside.  After some work, most
things are working, but deleting a row does not work right - but I have found a 
solution online to this.  With some tweaking to enable checking the delete, all
appears good.  More testing tomorrow, and after the Pins table editing is in place.

3/9/2018 - Reordered the fields in the gatePin table so they are in better order for
the related form.  Completed and did initial testing of form to edit pins through the
point where it displays in the data grid view.

3/10/2018 - Changed SQLToEntity translator to make a few int columns translate to C# type int?,
because they needed to be nullable.  Affected tables cardgate and gatepin.  
Changed EditCardGatesForm to check that the defining pin is not left empty.

3/10/2018 - Brought in cardLocationBottomNote table.  Started work on EditCardLocations
Form - layout complete.

3/11/2018 - A lot of work on the EditCardLocationForm.  Selection seems to be working,
and the dialog is populating except for the datagridview for the identified entries
(Sheet+coordinates).

3/12/2018 - Added DiagramPage table - used by CardLocationBlock.  Gave up on combo
boxes for row and column because I kept getting DataError events and it wasn't 
clear how to fix that - so now they are just text box columns.  I also used text
box columns for ECO and Diagram Page because the pick lists would possibly have
gotten way too long.  Dialog population and editing are done-ish.

3/13/2018 - Working on EditCardLocationBlockForm Apply and Delete buttons.  
The pre-update messaging / prep is coded and appears to be working.  Added the
code to do the actual updates as well, but theya re not yet tested.

3/14/2018 - regenerated cardlocation entity object - it had a "bool" from before I
recognized that causes problems - data base is "TINYINT".  Just had to regen the
entity object and fix the code for the check box.  Completed basic testing.
Changed datagrid to display sheet references by Col/Row, as that is how they are
displayed in the IBM card location charts (e.g. "4A").  Unfortunately, sorting by
page name, which would be desirable, would be really hard.    Maybe someday, but
today is not that day.

3/15/2018 - Removed leftover debugging code.  Removed redundant Add Volume Form
dialog - the Edit Volumes dialog handles adds as well.

3/15/2018 - Completed feature import, including a helper class that deals with
the file open/close/read and CSV parsing.

3/16/2018 - Working in Card Type / Gates / Pins importer.

3/17/2018 - Finished coding of Card Type / Gates / Pins importer.  This one is
smarter, in that it won't overwrite existing entries.  Created a utility logging
class in the base class Importer as well.  Eventually (maybe soon) that should
write to a file, and then provide a dialog for viewing the log.

3/17/2018 - Added a log display dialog for viewing import logs.

3/18/2018 - Increased Card Type name column to 80 characters, and changed
the EditCardTypesForm accordingly.  Removed some old comments/dead code
from EditCardGatesForm.   Added Transaction Begin/Commit to DbSetup object,
which TREMENDOUSLY improved import performance.  Tested and debugged
EditCardTypes import.  Fixed incorrect comment in getWhere in 
tables.cs (MySQLFramework).

3/18/2018 - Fixed EditCardTypesForm to use card type instead of name
in drop down list (bug fix).  Changed EditCardTypesForm, 
EditCardGatesForm and EditCardGatePinsForm to use a fixed font to
select the card type.

3/19/2018 - Added import startup dialog to capture Skip/Merge/Overwrite
when duplicates are encounted, and to capture the file name, that can
be shared by all the imports.

3/20/2018 - Worked on Feature import to include th new common dialogs
created after it was first developed.

3/21/2018 - Completed and tested updated feature import.  Fixed a
problem where deleting a card type in EditCardTypesForm did not delete
pins.

3/22/2018 - Changed EditCardTypesForm to add a separate combo box to 
select the volume to move the card to, and changes to how the original
combo box behaves as well, so that once a card is moved to another
volume, it stays set to the original volume.  Changed CardTypes import
to set the machineSerial to blank on any volume sets / volumes that
are created in the process.

3/22/2018 - Changed Importer base class to include an (optional) machine
serial number in the Volume lookup.  Added ECO lookup to Importer base
class.  Adjusted relevant Form to add the new paramter to Volume lookup.
Removed a TODO from a Form involving data grid view column width adjustment
that won't be happening.  Changed max column length for page table, and
adjusted EditCardLocationPage form to match.  Added TODO to 
EditCardLocation form to fix issue of it inserting rows with no volume
key.  If nothing else, it should "make one up" to make later editing
possible.  Added new Card Location Page importer, and added to menu.

3/22/2018 - Started work on Import for CardLocationCharts.

3/23/2018 - Added transaction cancel to Dbsetup - but not using it at
this point.  Added some more lookup/create methods to Importer base class.
Continued work on Card Location Charts import.

3/24/2018 - Added a test mode check box for import testing.  Finished
initial coding of Card Location Charts import.  

3/24/2018 - Increased length of note field in Card Location Bottom Notes 
table to 8.   Fixed bug in Importer base clase getCardType() - was not 
setting the type.   Well along in debugging Card Location Chart import, 
but still need to fix issue where part numbers do not consistenly have 
leading 0's in the input, and so do not match up - may need to use "LIKE"
or some such.

3/24/2018 - Added method in importer to pad part numbers out to 7 digits
with leading zeros (if they are numeric).  Also updated edit forms to
store the 7 digits.   Completed initial testing of Card Location Chart importer.

3/25/2018 - Debugging for Card Location Chart Importer done.  Importing
sheets.

3/27/2018 - Changed Edit Panels to use transactions (adding card slots
was taking quite a while).  Fixed bug in Edit Panels where changing the
Gate didn't populate datagridview.

3/27/2018 - Realized I was mislabing Frames as Gates in the spread sheets.
Deleted database rows imported, and fixed spreadsheets.  Working on
Tie Down import.  Removed extra colum check for a column named "" in
Card Location Page import.  Fixed comment related to headerin processing
in Feature Import.

3/28/2018 - Finished work on Tie Down Import.  Started work on EditTieDownsForm.

3/29/2018 - Continued work on EditTieDownsForm. 

3/31/2018 - Finished work on EditTieDownsForm.

4/1/2018 - Added firstPage and lastPage columns to volume table, so that import
and Edit functions can try to put sheets in the correct place.  Updated 
EditVolumeForm to handle the new columns.

4/2/2018 - Updated ImportCardLocationChart, ImportCardLocationPages, ImportTieDowns,
and EditCardLocation to use new columns in volume table.  Deleted old data and
re-imported Frame C Gate C Panel 1 to test.  Also changed EditCardLocationPageForm
to allow changes to fields (via combo boxes, typically) for a page without reloading 
the page.  This way those fields can be changed, though it can get a little confusing
to use.  May have to consider closing the dialog after each update to avoid confusion.
fields

4/3/2018 - Changed EditCardLocationPageForm to screen out diagram pages, lest 
it turn what was a diagram page into a twin diagram/card location page.  Added
the final tables into the setup: SheetEdgeInformation, DotFunction and
Connection.

4/3/2018 - Working on EditDiagramPage form.  Basic form is working except for
deletes (it does screen out Card Location Pages -- see above), and ECO Tag
maintenance is also coded and tested.  Added some ECO helpers to the Helper
class.

4/4/2018 - Added an order column to volume, to be used when displaying / editing /
using volume names in combo boxes.  (4/3) added leftSide and rightSide to 
sheetEdgeInformation table.  Updated several forms which have a volume pull-down,
including the ones dealing with SMS cards, gates and pins.

4/4/2018 - row field in sheetEdgeInformation table was char(2), which caused it
to generate as a "char" type.  Changed to VARCHAR(2).  Added sheet edge data
grid view to EditDiagramPageForm.  Changed TinyInt fields for leftSide and
rightSide in sheetEdgeInformation to by Tiny Int(4) to match up with the
INT data fields in the C# entity.  (Had already done that with checkMark
field in tiedown table, but have not (yet) done that in gatePin table.)
Tested Sheet Edge Information data grid view in EditDiagramPageForm.
Moved validDiagramRows static array from Importer.cs to Helpers.cs.

4/5/2018 - Factored out validPins, as I will also need it for the EditEdgeConnectorsForm.
Changed the Helpers Card Slot Info to return/use a new class, instead of a list of
strings / individual strings.  Changed EditTieDownsForm accordingly.

4/5/2018 - Started working on EditEdgeConnectorsForm.  Turns out that a datagridview
doesn't really handle an array, so I split it out into 8 separate fields, and
wrote a getter and setter to transfer between the class I use for the data grid
view, and an array.

4/6/2018 - Continued working on EditEdgeConnectorsForm.  Also changed the
EditDiagramPageForm to follow the recent pattern of having a doUpdates method
that is called twice, first just to get a message of what will be updated for
confirmation, and then again to apply the actual updates.

4/6/2018 - Continued working on EdgeConnectorsForm.  Finished initial coding,
but have not yet tested.  Factored the valid rows and valid pins into Helpers class, 
and changed EditPanelsForm, EditTieDownsForm and ImportCardLocationChart to match.

4/7/2018 - Finished testing EdgeConnectorsForm.  Rather than try and match up
reference numbers (which would have required a column containing the old reference
number to see if it changed), we now just delete all the old ones, and add them back
(changed or not).  

4/8/2018 - Started experimenting with Diagram Block Layout.

4/9/2018 - Working on EditDiagramBlocksForm.  Grid of buttons displays, and logic
blocks display the right information.

4/11/2018 - Added code to display dot functions.  Changed dotFunction table
logicFunction field from char(1) to varchar(1) (string instead of char).
Added form for editing dot functions.  Similar change to Connection table.
Also, key of connection table had been erroneously defined as VarChar(45)
instead of INT.  Fixed.  Tested EditDotFunctionForm.

4/11/2018 - Removed Apply button from EditDiagramBlocksForm, and 
renamed Cancel to Close.  There is no actual editing on this page - it 
is just a navigation/display page.  Started work on EditDiagramLogicBlockForm.

4/11/2018 - Factored out "Magic Number" 5 (number of diagram columns) into Helpers.
Continued work on EditDiagramLogicBlockForm.

4/12/2018 - Continued work on EditDiagramLogicBlockForm.  Panel displays OK for
empty slots, slots with current logic blocks, and slots with just a card location
chart entry.  Logic block display in text box coded and basically tested.

4/16/2018 - Continued work on EditDiagramBlockForm.  Now keeps state information
solely in the UI, and draws the diagram from that information.  Fixed bug in
EditDiagramBlocksForm to properly display ECO Tag.

4/17/2018 - Finished EditDiagramBlockForm and tested.

4/18/2018 - Started work on EditConnectionsForm.

4/20/2018 - Changed EditDiagramLogicBlockForm to recognize when nothing changed.  (It
cheats a little - when using the Edit Connections button, it does not care if the
direction of an extension changed (the regular apply button still always applies
updates, even when it does not need to).

4/21/2018 - Continued work on EditConnectionsForm and started work on EditConnectionForm.
(They will be easier to develop in tandem, to a degree.)

4/23/2018 - Finished coding on EditConnectionForm.  Not tested yet, and have not yet
pointed EditConnectionsForm methods to this new form.

4/24/2018 - Added code to invoke EditConnectionForm to EditConnectionsForm.  Also 
changed EditConnectionForm parameter from a connection to just the key.  Fixed an
issue in importers where log file was not closed if import errors occured. 
Increased length of bottom notes from 8 to 10 ("OVER HANG").

4/24/2018 - Changed Importer log display form to anchor Close button to bottom.
Started debugging EditConnectionsForm and EditConnectionForm.

4/25/2018 - Debugging EditConnectionsForm and EditConnectionForm

4/26/2018 - Fixed problem with EditEdgeConnectors where confirmation message
was so long, one could not see the button - changed to use the 
ImporterLogDisplayForm instead of a message box.  Fixed EditDiagramBlockForm
and EditDiagramBlockForm to use the machine name from the card slot identified
by the logic block instead of the machine name assocaited with the diagram
page for the logic block button text, the combo boxes dependent on the
machine and in the drawing display.  Fixed SQL syntax error for outputs in
EditConnectionForm.

4/27/2018 - EditConnectionForm Fixed bug - when selecting a connection to a gate, 
after selecting the gate entry, the application crashed.  PIVOT:  Changed the
handling of logic block pins from Gate level to Card level (the latter by
getting all of the pins in the card).  This is more consistent with capturing
the info on the drawings faithfully.  Continuing to debug connection editing.
Helpers: Added method to get all of the input or output pins of a card.

4/27/2018 - EditConnectionForm Fixed problems with Edge Connector reference handling
EditConnectionForm:  toEdgeConenctorReference is now also used in the rare case 
where a gate-gate connection has an Edge Connector reference (e.g., to 1415 lamps)
EditConnecitonsForm:  Add * in front of non-empty Edge Connector References, and 
also display them for gate-gate connections.

4/28/2018 - EditDiagramPageForm - added in missing New Page button functionality.
Tested Dot Functions.

4/29/2018 - EditConnectionForm - added another combo box where user can select a 
load pin (identified as +IBM Logic Function "L") (both show in ALD logic block)
(Note:  decided NOT to exclude load pins from the regular output list, though
we may do so later.)

4/29/2018 - EditDiagramLogicBlockForm - Close form after apply, removed dead
variables, pre-select logic levels based on first gate of card, force
symbol and title to upper case.  Fixed tabbing order.

4/30/2018 - EditConnectionForm - Changed dialog to display an Open Collector
label for the selected output pin.  Adjusted tab order.  
EditConnectionsForm - Display row next to signal name in table, and changed
background color to emphasize that dgv is read only.  

4/30/2018 - EditConnectionsForm - added inputOutput string to class
ConnectionInfo.  EditDotFunctionForm - added read only data grid view of connections.

4/30/2018 - Shortened machine to varchar(8), added description as varchar 255. 
Started work on EditMachinesForm, using a datagridview approach, to replace
EditMachineForm.

5/2/2018 - IBM1410SMSForm - changed to use EditMachinesForm.  EditMachinesForm: Debugged.
EditMachineForm: Removed.

5/3/2018 - IBM1410SMSForm - Removed Add menu and its (add) machine and (add) volume set
entries.  Changed EditVolumeSet to EditVolumeSets.  Removed Select menu.  
Added and debugged EditVolumeSetsForm.
Removed AddMachineForm and AddVolumeSetForm.

5/3/2018 - Removed ` from SQL queries, as they represent an unintended MySQL
dependency:

EditVolumeSetForm:         REMOVED (no longer userd)

Helpers:                   volume.set (in getOrAddDiagramPageKey)
EditCardGatePinsForm:      volume.set volume.order
EditCardGatesForm:         volume.set volume.order
EditCardLocationForm:      volume.set volume.order
EditCardLocationpageForm:  volume.set volume.order
EditCardTypesForm:         volume.set volume.order cardlocation.type
EditCardTypesForm:         removed ` from (machine) name
EditCardTypesForm:         Fixed a bug in editing ECO dates
EditConnectionForm:        edgeconnector.order
EditConnectionsForm:       connection.from/to  connection.fromPin/toPin
EditDiagramBlocksForm:     cardlocationblock.ignore
EditDiagramLogicBlockForm: cardgate.number
EditDiagrampageForm:       volume.set volume.order
EditEdgeConnectorsForm:    edgeconnector.order (2 instances)
EditTieDownsForm:          volume.set
EditVolumeForm:            volume.set volume.order
ImportCardLocationChart:   volume.set
ImportCardTypes:           cardtype.type, cardgate.number
Importer:                  volume.set
ImportTieDowns:            volume.set (2 instances)

5/3/2018:  Decided against: Display database ID in TITLE area of forms associated with single entities.

5/3/2018:  Fixed spread sheet for gate DFS, defining pin Q:  D is an output (not an input)

5/3/2018:  For now, I decided against messing with machine suffix/prefix code.  For future
reference, this kind of thing appears in EditDiagramBlocksForm (prefix),
EditDiagramLogicBlock(prefix,suffix), EditDotFunction(prefix), 
EditEdgeConnectors(prefix,suffix) and ImportTieDowns (suffix).
In a lot of cases, these are just for display purposes.

5/3/2018 - Fixed references to card type ABM => ABN, deleted card type ABM.
Reconciled two card types DFC.  Part # in SMS card spreadsheet was wrong.
EditCardTypesForm - Fixed issue with not handling a null logic family.

5/9/2018 - Having abandoned the "defining pin" concept (because some gates
have no unique pin), I instead added a new cardGate column to the
diagramBlock table, and a pull down for it in EditDiagramLogicBlockForm.
Also now check for references to cardGate from the diagramBlock table in
EditCardGatesForm when deleting gates.

5/9/2018 - Changed ImportCardTypes to handle oscillator frequency.

5/9/2018 - Reimported gates with Merge to pick up DPQ, YLD, YLB, YLE, 
YLH, YLJ, YLF and YLG.

5/9/2018 - Discovered / remembered that Load pins MUST be defined as OUTPUTS.
Fixed YLF and tested.

5/10/2018 - EditConnectionForm: Changed to make polarity an output property.
EditConnectionForm:  Put in check that required combo box selections made,
depending upon selected connection type.
EditConnectionForm:  Disabled/enabled controls based on selected connection type.
EditConnectionsForm:  Changed to display polarity on all outputs.
EditDiagramLogicBlock:  Include new cardGate combo box in test for modified.
EditDiagramLogicBlock:  Include dashes for output in drawing, depending upon polarity.

5/13/2018:  EditDiagramBlocksForm: Added G#:In/Out to ALD diagram buttons
EditECOsForm:  Sort ECOs.

5/13/2018:  Database cleanup.  Deleted following database IDs:
Page 170593 (88.87.86.1), Diagram Page 170594
Page 170589 (88.87.86.85), Diagram Page 170590
Page 999201
Card Location Page 999200
Volume 170615
DiagramBlock 999300, 999301, 999302
Panel 999101, Slot 999901, Frame 170612, Panel 170613, Slot 170614 and 170620, Frame 170613(?)
Card Location 999200, 100908
Feature 999001, 999002, 170618
TieDown 170621
Set Machine for ECO 185966 ('111803') to 0 (it is an SMS ECO)

5/14/2018: EditDiagramPageForm:  Force title to upper case on update.  Added Comment field.  
Made "Remove" button not visible.
EditCardLocationPageForm:  Force title to upper case on update.

5/14/2018: Database/SpreadSheet:  Fixed various Load "Gates":
DEB (Clamp): Changed all the existing pins to output, J to input (0V)
TFK Added Q as an input (it is a voltage input, show in the ALD)
DGK 2nd gate, Q Input, A Output.  Pins G, F, B, D and C outputs.
   (But there was no way to associate a delay value with each pin)
DAC Gate 4 L output
DPQ Gate 7 M Output
DPB Gate 3 B Output, Gate 4 C Output
DPV Gate 6 Q output, Gate 7 P Output
YLD Gate 7, YLB Gate 5, YLE Gate 7, YLH gate 4, YLJ Gate 4, YLF Gate 4, YLG Gate 4 - Outputs

5/14/2018 - EditDotFunctionForm: fixed issue where a new DOT function was displaying
connections (likely from things that were NOT DOT functions).
EditDiagramLogicBlockForm: Redraw logic block drawing on return from EditConnectionsForm.

5/17/2018 - Database:  Added (standard) logic functions ONE and ZERO.

5/17/2018 - Still need to work on load gates.  In a way, the load is an input (for a
connection), and it is useful to be able to do that when a load is showing on a
connection destined for a sheet edge, but it shows as an output from the logic block
on a diagram, and is searched for as an output when looking for load pins on a logic 
block.  It may make sense to simply mark them as BOTH input and output.  
[Which is what I ended up doing.]

5/19/2018: EditCardGatesForm:  Allow transistor number of 0 in datagrid.
EditConnectionForm:  Handle keypress for shortcuts for +, -, Pin, Gate, Edge
EditConnecitonForm:  When no existing connection, set open collector label
  visibility based on first combo box pin.
EditConnectionForm:  Fixed spelling of Destination in label, added missing tooltips.
EditConnectionsForm:  Added "*Ref -or- " to Row / Signal Name output column header.
EditDiagramPageForm:  Fold diagram ECO tags (name) to upper case on update.
EditDiagramBlocksForm:  Added additional DOT function button for column 1 - it
 turns out that sometimes a DOT function is to the right of the rightmost gate,
 connecting to a sheet edge signal.
 EditDotFunctionForm:  Added the ability to edit connections from the DOT 
  function to a sheet edge (yeah, sometimes they are like that).
EditDotFunctionEdgeConnectionForm: New: For editing a connection from a DOT function
  to a sheet edge.

5/19/2018: EditDiagramLogicBlockForm: Preselect Feature in feature combo box from card location when first 
editing a logic block.
EditConnectionForm:  If editing a sheet edge input, pre-fill in the page name from
the selected signal name.
EditConnectionsForm:  Change name of button column to EditButton - needed because
a column named "edit" was added to the ConnectionInfo class.

5/20/2018: EditDiagramLogicBlockForm: Fixed bug introduced by feature preselect 
causing issues for new logic blocks that were not in the card location chart.
EditConnectionForm: Set e.handled in keypress handler to avoid those characters
from getting used in the controls (+, -, G, D, E).

5/21/2018: Changed resistor pins on DFJ to In/Out.

5/22/2018: EditConnectionForm:  Assume positive polarity on new input connections
from another gate.

5/29/2018: EditConnectionForm:  Tab order +/- at the very end.
EditConnectionForm: When selected row/signal changes, if isInput and not 1 source, clear
sheet text box.
EditConnectionForm: When pin changes, set open collector visible only if !isInput.
EditConnectionsForm:  Set DataGridView tabstops to false;  Initial Focus on AddInput button
EditDotFunctionForm:  Anchor DataGridView to bottom left.
EditDiagramLogicBlockForm:  No tabstop on Output On Left checkbox.
EditDiagramLogicBlockForm:  Set Block Configuration tab stop right after ECO tag tab stop.

5/30/2018:
EditConnectionsForm:  Changed method call from Focus() to Select() to focus on AddInput button.
EditDiagramLogicBlockForm:  Increased length of diagramblocktitletextbox from 8 to 10
(Database, at 20, was unaffected.)
EditDotFUnctionForm:  ALSO anchor Datagrid view to top and right.

5/31/2018:  Added Card ZKV, referenced from 11.40.01.1.  
Modified Capacitor card AET:  Capacitors need to be inputs as well as outputs.
Modified card DEQ:  For gate with output on pin A, H is also an Input
Modified card DAX:  Load pin has to be I/O, because one page uses it as an input.

6/2/2018:
Database:  Table Connection, add column fromEdgeConnectorReference (these are showing up on the
input side, not just the output side).
EditConnectionsForm:  Removed tab stop on card type, display fromEdgeConnectorReference, handle
"--" intra-card connections.
EditConnectionForm:  Handle input side edge connector references.  Handle "--" intra-card
connections.
Helpers:+getGatePins()  Add pin "--" to represent intra card connections.

6/3/2018:  Card type DEA, changed all gates output levels from S to blank.
Card type DFA, set Pin to intra gate input from to gate 8 as pin F.

6/4/2018:  Card TYPE DFA, set pin to intra gate input to gate 4 as pin P.
CAN'T set intra gate input to gate 2 as pin P (2-3 connection has no pin, editor complains)

6/5/2018:  EditConnectionForm: Removed tab stops completely for +/-
EditConnectionsForm:  Anchored output datagridview to bottom.  Set both
datagridviews to autosize AllCells so signal name would not get cut off.

6/7/2018:  BUG: EditDiagramPageForm failed on add with null sheetEdgeInformationList.
Fixed  (and also fixed potential for ECOs to do the same thing.).   Changed sheet
edge information data grid view to AutoSizeColumnsMode = All Cells and widened the
page -- too many signal names were getting cut off.
EditDotFunctionEdgeConnectionForm:  Changed to allow inputs to DOT functions from
sheet edge signals.
EditDotFunctionForm:  Renamed addOutputButton to addInputOutputButton.
Changed connections data grid to use autosize columns mode = all cells and made dialog
a little bigger so signal names are not cut off as often.
Added edge reference for edge inputs to DOT functions.
Enabled Edit button functionality on sheet edge inputs to DOT functions.

6/7/2018:  Changed ImportersLogDisplayForm (used by EditEdgeConnectorsForm) to
have focus on the OK button when used.  

6/7/2018:  Fixed EditDotFunctionEdgeConnectionForm to pre-populate the
sheetTextBox if it is an input and the signal name matches exactly one
output sheet.  EditDiagramLogicBlockForm: If the apply/edit connections button is
clicked, only proceed if the apply portion was successful.

6/8/2018: Card type DAC, pin L is I/O - fixed in database and spreadsheet.

6/8/2018: Added EditSheetEdgeOutputConnectionsForm to allow pre-popoulation/easy
entry of multiple output (right side) sheet edge references from gates (but
not DOT functions...).
EditConnectionForm:  Changed to add Populate button and invocation of the
EditSheetEdgeOutputConnectionsForm.

6/8/2018:  Fixed an issue with +S OP MOD REG 8 BIT - it had erroniously been
entered for page 13.12.01.1 when entering page 12.12.40.1, noticed the error
when that same signal showed up on 12.12.50.1.

6/9/2018: EditDiagramPageForm:  Fixed "Edgie" typo in message.
EditConnectionForm:  Select combo box next to radio button when selected.
Preselect Pin combo box initially.
EditDiagramLogicBlock:  Select first "real" ECOtag, unless there are none.

6/9/2018: Something went wrong during card location chart import between 11D2 and
11D3.  Starting with page 12.12.60.1, I am seeing cards that should be 11D3 showing
up as 11D2 - and that is consistent with the (wrong) information in the database.
(Turned out that on the spreadsheet, I had 11.04.07.0 in the sheet column, that
should have been 11.04.08.0.  The part number was also wrong.)

Fixing will require:

   1.  Foreach bad page (11.04.07.0, 11.04.08.0)
           for all  cardLocation rows referring to that page
		          delete cardLocationBottomNotes referring to that cardLocation
				  delete cardLocationBlock rows referring to that location
			      delete the cardLocation
		   

   2.  Finding the bug that caused this in the first place
   3.  Re-import the card location chart page

6/9/2018:  Added "Force Purge" to EditCardLocationPageForm to do step 1.
Importer:  Fixed a bug where getVolumeKeyByName was not including the
machineSerial in the insert, causing lots of duplicate volumes (and
their associated pages).

6/9/2018:  EditSheetEdgeOutputConnections - Fix null pointer issues when adding a
new connection that has no *Ref

6/10/2018: EditConnectionForm:  Remove the initial differentiation between input
and output for gateRefComboBox.
EditDiagramLogicBlockForm:  Tab order:  Gate follows block configuration.

6/10/2018:  Database:  Added column toEdge2ndConnectorReference Varchar(4) to
connection table.
EditSheetEdgeOutputConnectionsForm:  Add column to datagridview for 2nd connector 
 reference, and handle accordingly.  This allows adding entries.  Also, set error
 text in data grid view for errors.
EditDotFunctionForm:  Add code to display toEdge2ndConnectorReference when present.
EditConnectionsForm:  Add code to display toEdge2ndConnectorReference when present.
EditDotFunctionEdgeConnectionForm:  Add code to initialize toEdge2ndConnectorReference,
  however, it does not allow adding/changing one at present - not expecting to see that.
EditConnectionForm:  
   Add 2nd combo box for 2nd edge reference, and associated label.
   Add clone of first list (they cannot change in sync) for data source.
   Add clone of first list for gate combo box, which also should really not change in sync.
   Removed spurious if around reference combo box init - there will always at least be
      an empty "default" entry.
   Disabled Edge reference labels/combo boxes when connection is not from/to and Edge.
   Initialized 2nd edge reference to blank when not from/to an Edge.

6/10/2018:  EditEdgeConnectorsForm:  Added two more columns.

6/10/2018: EditConnectionForm:  Existing connections can have null (rather than an empty
string) for toEdge2ndConnectorReference, so if that happens, initialize it to an empty
string in the code.   
Changed edge connections from 11.10.02.1:1D to use C / +S 2ND CLOCK PULSE 2 and deleted
D / +S 2ND CLOCK PULSE 2

6/11/2018:  Volume II data entry complete:
   865 Diagram Blocks
  1986 Sheet Edge Signal rows
   480 Distrince sheet edge signals
  2868 Connections

6/13/2018:  Continued work on HDL generation.

6/14/2018:  Continued work on HDL generation.
EditSheetEdgeOutputConnectionsForm: Forced references to upper case, and make sure it did
not store a null for a blank/empty reference in either to-edge connection column.

6/19/2018:  Continued work on HDL generation.  Testing/debugging header generation and
gate/connection validation.

6/20/2018:  Added Parms class to "persist" user interface data.
GenerateHDLForm:  Now uses Parms class for machine, volume set, volume and output directory.
EditDiagramPageForm:  Now uses Parms class for machine and volume set.  Issues with bad index
when I try to use volume, and it messes up the ECO data grid for unknown reasons if I try to
use page.

6/20/2018:  GemerateHDL: Fixed BUG:  Did not properly show pin in message about a pin going to a DOT
function along with something else.

6/20/2018:  EditConnectionForm:  Removed Console.Writeline()
GenerateHDL:  Rewrote latch detection to detect two levels deep and tested. 
(It will be interesting to see if there are cases deeper than that)

6/20/2018: EditDiagramLogicBlockForm:  Fixed issue in text display when input level is
2 characters (or longer) long.

6/21/2018: EditConnectionForm:  Issue warning if multiple different output pins.
GenerateHDL:  Issue warning if multiple different output pins.

6/21/2018: EditConnectionForm.  Fixed but in multiple output pins - it should only
check on outputs.  ;)  Also, added check on inputs if pin is not "--" - the same pin
should not occur more than once.

6/21/2018:  EditDiagramPageForm:  Now displays connection count for each sheet edge signal.
EditDiagramLogicBlockForm:  Fixed bug where if machine, frame, gate or panel changed, the
Apply + Edit Connections button would not apply updaates.
GenerateHDL:  Created shared method to generate output pin names (used both during
signal declaration, and in logic statements)  NOT YET TESTED.

6/22/2018:  EditDiagramPageForm:  Refesh dialog to get updated sheet edge signal 
counts after returning from editing logic blocks.
GenerateHDL:  Fix silly typo.

6/22/2018:  Tested earlier changes to GenerateHDL.
EditConnectionForm:  Fixed issue of to/from Edge Connection not clearing out the
to/from DiagramBlock/Pin/Polarity/DotFunction, so if a connection was changed, the old 
data made it show up in the old place.

6/22/2018:  GenerateHDL:  Started working on actual logic generation.
Discovered a 3 gate latch loop in 11.10.06.1:  
  4IE => 3IA => 3IF => 3HB => 3HH => 4IA,
  so worked on a full circular logic check algorithm.

6/23/2018:  Helpers.getOrAddECOKey:  Force letters in an ECO to upper case.
GenerateHDL:  Rewrote combinatorial loop detection - generalized - and tested.

6/24/2018:  GenerateHDL:  Fixed issue with intra-gate (--) pins.
Added generation of output signal assignments.

6/25/2018:  EditCardGatePinsForm:  Changed to allow no pin specification so long
as it is a connection to another gate.  Also, fixed bug where error text always
showed up on the first row.

6/25/2018:  GenerateHDLForm:  Issue a message if no pages were matched/generated.
GenerateHDL:  Output VHDL statements for D Flip Flip after latched outputs.
Also, add additional comment to VHDL prefix, and genrate VHDL suffix.

6/25/2018:  Documentation:  Added documentation on logic editing

6/26/2018:  Helpers: added method to obtain machine name given a page.
GenerateHDL:  Added actual statement generation for simple logic functions, and
fixed some generated syntax bugs.

6/27/2018:  EditEdgeConnectorsForm:  Set max input length of cells to 8.
EditDiagramPageForm:  Warn if a signal appears on RHS of more than one sheet.
GenerateHDL:  Treat SS like T.  Also, in the latch algorithm, never put a "T" or
"SS" on the to process list.
GenerateHDLLogic:  New abstract class to factor out common method names so that
I can change/keep GenerateHDL HDL language independent.
GenerateHDLLogicVHDL: New subclass of GenerateHDLLogic for generating HDL.
(Have not yet pulled the code out of GenerateHDL to use these new classes)

6/30/2018:  Inconsistent Handling of card type AEK on my part.
Target:  I think I want to add the extra input and use a special equation.
Page 11.10.32.1:  Added a wired OR (to fix)  (DONE)

7/1/2018: EditEdgeConnectorsForm:  Anchored buttons to the bottom of the form.
EditSheetOutputEdgeConnectorsForm: Anchored buttons to the bottom fo the form.
EditConnectionForm:  Enable popoulate button regardless of how many references
there are, so long as there are no existing sheet edge connections from the gate.
EditDiagramPageForm:  Fix coding error in SQL statement.

7/1/2018: Changed GenerateHDL to use the new GenerateHDLLogicVHDL subclass.
GenerateHDLLogicVHDL:  Added signal delcaration for intermediate output for latches,
and added library declarations for what Xilinx suggests using instead of
library "work", called "xil_defaultlib".

7/1/2018:  Had two pages 00.00.00.0, one for the 1411, one for the 1415, and
it was causing annoying warnings.  Renamed the console one to 00.00.00.0CC ,
and also added (CC) to its signal names that were not already prefaced with
"CONS".

7/2/2018:  EditDiagramLogicBlockForm:  Take machine to pass down to EditConnections
from the diagram rather than the logic block.
Database:  Added mapPin column to table gatePin.  This column specifies the name
to use when instantiating a gate with a logic function of "Special".

7/2/2018:  Database:  Added HDLname to cardGate, to use when instantiating a gate
with a logic function of "Special".
ImportCardTypes:  Set cardGate.HDLname to "" when importing.  Also set mapPin to ""
when importing.
EditCardGatesForm:  Add support for new HDLname column.
Helpers:  Initialize mapPin for "--" gates.
EditCardGatePinsForm:  Add support for new mapPin column.

7/2/2018:  Analyzed AEK circuit with LTSpice.  If IN1 = {D, F, P} and IN2 {E, G, B} and
OOUT = {C, A, H} then OUT = NOT(IN1) OR IN2 .  (Input E is for a dot function
with another O/C gate coming in).

7/3/2018:  GenerateHDLLogicVHDL:  Added code to generate entity generation for
logic gates with logic function "Special".
GenerateHDLLogic:  Added code to generate entity generation for logic gates with 
logic function "Special".
GenerateHDL:  Added code to generate entity generation for logic gates with 
logic function "Special".
Ignore connections from pin M to the same gate.

7/4/2018:  GenerateHDL:  Forced needsClock to true, so that the clock is always
in the port map.  (If this turns into an issue, the alternative will likely be
to add a needsClock column to the diagramPage table, and set it during
generation, but also allow it to be set/cleared in EditDiagramPageForm).

7/5/2017:  GenerateHDL, GenerateHDLLogic, GenerateHDLogicVHDL:
Fixed issue where an unpinned output generated two different output names,
but only the first was assigned (name changed to say OUT_xx_NoPin instead of
the destination coordinate).
Added code to handle multiple output pins for special and trigger gates, which can happen,
for example, when a trigger and its extension are merged.
Initialized pins list in GenerateHDL for new blocks to an empty list, instead of null.
Treat Logic function "Trigger" the same as "Special".
Merge mapped pins that on an extension that are not already present in master onto the master.
EditCardGatePinsForm:  Set maximum text length on mapName column
t=o eight, to match check during generation.

7/6/2018:  GenerateHDLLogicVHDL:  If logic function is Trigger, include a clock.
GenerateHDL:  For an extension, change all of the connections *from* its outputs
to be *from* the master logic block.

7/10/2018:  GenerateHDL:  get file name extension GenerateHDLLogic::generateHDLExtension
Sort signal names by row.  
Add some missing tool tips.
GenerateHDLLogic:  Add abstract method generateHDLExtension.
Remove unused field logicBlocks.
GenerateHDLLogicVHDL:  Implement new generateHDLExtension method.
IBM1410SMSForm:  Add menu item for generating group pages.
GenerateGroupHDLForm, GenerateGroupHDL, GenerateGroupHDLLogic, GenerateGroupHDLLogicVHDL: 
New classes to generate group pages.  Not yet tested.

7/11/2018: GenerateHDLForm:  Order pages by name.
GenerateHDLLogic:  Replace two underscores by 1 in generateSignalName 
(VHDL does not allow consecutive underscores).
GenerateHDLLogicVHDL:  Fix null pointer problem that occured if a pin used in a 
logic block with logicFunction Special does not have a associated pin in in the gate.
(Issue error message(s))
GenerateGroupHDL:  Add many more logMessage calls.  Fix broken SQL.  
Rename generateHDLGroup() to generateGroupHDL().  Make logFileName available
as a field.  Fix broken leftSide/rightSide compares.  
Move generateHDLArchitectureSuffix outside of the entity loop, and also
close the log and ouput files properly.
GenerateGroupHDLForm:  Add forgotten instantiation and invocation of 
generateGroupHDL and log display.
GenerateGroupHDLLogic:  Replace two underscores by 1 in generateSignalName.
GenerateGroupHDLLogicVHDL:  Fix a few small generation errors (spacing, mostly)

7/12/2018:  Volume III Data entry complete.
  2087 Diagram Blocks (+1222)
  4347 Sheet Edge Signal rows (+2361)
  1078 Distrinct sheet edge signals (+598)
  7121 Connections (+4253)

7/12/2018:  EditEdgeConnectorsForm:  Remove maximum size on datagradview.
EditDiagramLogicBlockForm:  Change title from default.
  Change Apply button tax index to 58, right after Gate pull down.
EditDiagramPageForm:  Implement remove button (and remove some old junk!)

7/12/2018:  GenerateHDLForm:  Waits for user to close log file dispaly before proceeding.
GenerateHDL:  Warn if a logic block uses a pin not defined for a given gate.  (This will
prompt some clean up of mis-entered pins and/or adding some appropriate pins to gates.)
GenerateGroupHDL, GenerateGroupHDLLogic, GenerateGroupHDLLogicVHDL:
Handle situation where VHDL does not allow something that is an output in the PORT list
to be read - created signals as a "buffer" for them.

7/12/2018:  Allow any single character for a signal "row" to handle pages that 
have *tons* of input signals.

7/13/2018:  Fix a couple of null pointer errors when adding a new card location to
a card location page.

7/15/2018:  Ran into my first case where an intra-card connection is 
represented as a DOT Function (Card DER, page 13.50.07.1).  
For now, the work-around is to number the un-pinned connection with a pin 
(in or out) that is the gate number.    (Kind of too bad that they didn't 
just wrap that up into a single logic block, like they do with AEK cards.)

7/19/2018:  EditDiagramLogicBlockForm:  Add blockConfiguration to ist of things
checked to identify modifications.
EditConnectionForm:  Add Cancel button to delete confirmation message box.
EditSheetEdgeOutputConnectionsForm:  Reset data grid view row error text if
a cell is changed.
EditDotFunctionEdgeConnectionForm:  Fix tab order for +/- .
EditDiagramLogicBlockForm:  Added notes field to handle the odd cases where	
a card has an internal connection (e.g., CAP with AJ) or a cut trace/pin
(X-J has been seen)
EditEdgeConnectorsForm:  Cancel transaction if a card slot cannot be created
(e.g., a connection identifying a machine not yet defined in the database,
like the IBM 1414).   Move transaction code into applyUpdates().

7/20/2018:  EditSheetEdgeOutputConnectionsForm:  Fixed an index out of range
issue when displaying an empty populate screen, caused by previous fix on 7/19.
EditEdgeConnectorsForm:  Included message from getting/adding card slot key
(seem to be getting spurious messages indicating a problem getting or adding 
card slot key)
EditDotFunctionForm:  Fixed issue where a DOT function with connections was
deleted (along with its connections) even if the user cancelled the delete.

7/22/2018:  EditDiagramBlocksForm:  Null pointer error.  When looking up
non 0 ECO in a card location block, it was trying to use the (nonexistant)
diagramBlock ECO instead of the card location block ECO.

7/26/2018  EditEdgeConnectors issues error messages for unknown card slots during
   update check phase.   Ignore messages during check phase.  Also, during
   update, only repopulate the dialog on a successful update.
ImporterLogDisplayForm:  Cancel button anchor fix.

7/27/2018:  Helpers:  Added '9' to list of valid pins, so I could use it for
the output of the second gate group of card DFM (Gate 9).
GenerateHDLLogicVHDL:  Added code to remember when a signal for a nopin has been
generated, since a nopin output can go to more than one block.  Also handle
latched outputs from nopins (nopin == intracard connection not assigned a pin)

7/28/2018:  EditConnectionForm:  / key now selects the last entry in the pin list
(typically used for -- nopin pins).
EditDiagramLogicBlockForm:  Removed G from gate pick list, so now gate number can
be entered to select the gate (useful for registers where we look up the gate
number because of all of the nopin gates.)

8/31/2018:  One gate of card DHP, P/N 370502 is not well depicted on ALDs.  
The ALDs show pins B, C as an input to an inverter (which is T14, Gate 6) as 
input to a block, along with the output of another inverter that follows the 
NAND of PQR.  Neither input has an assigned pin on the diagram, but the 
inverter fed by the NAND of PQR comes in on the right side as a DOT function 
(like card AEK gates).  To make this work, I assigned a virtual pin "X" to the 
output of the inverters fed by pins B and C, and "Y" to the output of the 
inverter that follows the NAND of PQR.  The equation is OUT (pin a) = NOT(X) OR Y.

9/1/2018:  EditEdgeConnectorsForm:  Fixed bug that allowed creation of lower case
card slot row names.

10/25/2018:  Sheets 17.11.02.1 thru 17.12.04.1 were mostly unpopulated with
logic blocks owing to missing card location chart pages.  Used sheets to create
card location chart entries.

1/4/2019:  EditDiagramPageForm - surrounded column name "row" in ORDER BY clause
with back-ticks - new issue with MySQL 8.  Not sure how I can fix that in a better
way - perhaps use pattern matching looking for ORDER BY clause in query execution.

1/21/2020: (wow - an entire year went by)  Made dialog EditDiagramBlocksForm that shows 
all the blocks slightly larger so it would not need scroll bars.

1/22/2020: Added a card type usage report.  Even while testing it caused me to spot 
pin errors on some logic blocks which were corrected.  Will use this to check pins 
on DHL and DEG (a task noted earlier)

1/23/2020:  Used card type usage report to investigate gate types DEG and DHL.
DEG Corrections to inputs and outputs to "S" on 14.30.06.1 4H,
18.12.01.1 5A and 5D, 18.12.02.1 5A

1/23/2020:  Checked error messages in Edit Card Gates, and they seem to work 
properly.

1/23/2020:  Changed EditEdgeConnectorsForm to have Environment.Newline at the end
of all messages.

2/22/2020 Added pages, interconnect, logic blocks, DOT functions etc. to documentation.

PENDING:  BUG:  Edit Connection.  Editing a gate to gate connection that has an

ERRATA:

These are things that are not errors in the application, but things that are either
inconsistent or apparently incorrect in the IBM 1410 SMS ALDs (sometimes likely because
some of the sheets are for a machine with the accelerator RPQ but others are not.)

5/19/2018:  11.10.02.1 - There is a "Wired OR" between DEY 3B pin B and YLF 3D pin D -
but neither one is actually open collector.  Wonder if that issue persisted on real
machines.  (There are more cases of that in other sheets)

5/29/2018:  11.20.09.1  Output signal is labeled +S I RING 1+2+5+6+10 TIME, however
the input to pin H for the gate (2B) also includes -S I RING 7 TIME

5/29/2018:  Left over deleted edge input signal +S I RING 8 TIME on 
page 11.20.11.1 - removed.

6/3/2018: 12.12.04.1 Card 9LMP 1I shows as 15A8H10, amost certainly s/b 15A1H10.

6/4/2018:  12.12.30.1 has a wired or of two input signals to sheet, 
+S ARITH STOP AT F * ARITH and +S STOP AT F.  I added two dummy EQU gates,
type JRJ1, for each input, and fed that to a wired OR.  
Also, the signal name "+S STOP AT F" is used for two different signals.
I renamed the one that runs between 12.12.30.1 and 12.12.32.1
"+S STOP AT F JRJ".  These dummies were later removed, when I allowed
DOT functions to have edge inputs.

6/23/2018:  Fixup for card location pages that did not have the correct first
line left a vestage card location page entry, database 163019 - removed. 
(It was replaced by database entry 175464, and 163019 does not have any
card location rows referring to it.)

6/28/2018:  Cards DGA, DFZ not set up properly.  Inputs, by gate, should be
QP, DK, EF and HR.  Main output, by gate, is B, A, C, L.  Auxiliary outputs
on all gates are  G, J and M.

6/29/2018:  Card DFD not set up properly.  Pin R is an input to Gate 4,
along with P and Q.  Fixed.

7/15/2018:  Ran into first case of card location chart and ALD logic
diagram disagreeing about placement.  Card 11D3E03, AEK shows as sheet
coordinate 2F on the card location chart, but 1F on the actual page.
The ECO on the Chart is 253322, the last ECO on the seet is 253150,
so something likely changed, but I put the logic block as identified
on the sheet rather than the chart.

7/15/2018:  Another first (seems to be the day for them.)  Sheet
12.12.67.1 has +S E CH In PROCESS from sheet 13.60.04.1, but the
latter sheet does not show the signal as being output to 
12.12.67.1.  (I left it in place, with the signal present)

7/19/2018:  Sheet 13.65.07.1 EC 251829 has a logic block at 3E,
11D3E25.  However the card location chart does not show that block,
though it does show the ones at 3D and 3F.

7/22/2018:  Sheet 13.67.02.1 EC 251823 has a logic block at 3B,
11D4F27.  The Card location chart does not show that block, but does
have a bogus one at 13.62.02.1 

[UNRESOLVED] 7/22/2018:  Sheet 13.67.02.1 EC 251823 shows output signal 
"-S F CH INT END OF XFER DELAYED" as going to sheet 13.64.07.1 EC
253150.  However, the latter shows the input signal as +S, not -S.
I will use the later E.C. as the correct one for now.  Since 3B is
the source for that signal, there is a pretty good chance that 
said block was simply dropped in the later E.C., which is why it was
not in the card location chart.

[UNRESOLVED] 7/22/2018:  Sheet 13.67.02.1 EC 251823 shows output signal
"+S F CH SECOND SAMPLE B" as going to sheet 13.64.05.1 EC
251829.  However, the latter does not show that signal as an input.
(They do agree on signal "-S F CH STATUS SAMPLE B DELAY")

7/22/2018:  Sheet 13.70.02.1 EC 252637 shows a signal
"+S 1401 CARD PRINT IN PROC" but sheet 13.60.04.1 named the
signal "+S 1401 CARD-PRINT IN PROC".  I used the name with the space,
even though the former is an earlier EC than the latter, because
another sheet used the name with a space (12.12.46.1, same EC)

7/25/2018:  The signal "-S 1ST DATA STROBE LATCH" was not differentiated
by channel (sources 13.72.04.1 and 13.73.04.1)  Added "CH F" to the
end of the F channel signal to differentiate it.  

[UNRESOLVED] 7/26/2018:  Page 12.12.67.1 has an input signal
"-S F CH FILE OP" which originates on page 13.74.01.1, however
the latter page does not output that signal.  (Would be easy to create
logic to do that, however)

[UNRESOLVED] 7/26/2018:   Page 12.12.67.1 has an input signal
"+S FILE OP DLY EXTENSION" which originates on page 13.74.01.1, however
the latter page does not output that signal.

9/12/2018:  The signals coming from 15.30.0[1-6].1 to 15.41.04.1 and
15.41.07.1 did not match with their destinations.  The two destination 
sheets had signals "+B B CH * BIT" and "+B B CH NOT * BIT" where * is
1248AB, but the source signals were, correspondingly, "+S B CH NOT * BIT" 
and "+S B CH * BIT".  I suspect that this is because the source pages
are *not* for the accelerated feature, but the destination sheets are.
The best way to deal with that sort of thing, really, would be to allow
the same sheet number to exist, but under different ECO levels, which I
did not plan for.  So I worked around it by adding the signals shown on
the destination sheets, sourcing them from the same gate as the +S signal
with the same name, and updating the source sheet to source the signal as
expected by the destination sheet.  To be accurate, I should have added
YLK level-shifting inverters in the process, but I did not do that yet,
because I didn't know what slot I could use for sure.

10/11/2018  Ran into some more of this.   These were from 15.30.0-1-6].1
again, this time into 15.12.*.1

10/24/2018  Card Location Chart 11.04.04.0 (1411 C 3) shows a DPV card at
G10, sheet 16.49.05.1.  This is a typo - it should read 15.49.05.1, where
a resistor on this card appears at sheet coordinate 1G.

INFO:  NOR (DTL) Gates:  DEG, DEH, DEJ, DEK, DEL, DGL, DGM, DHL, DMN, DMX,

So far, only page we see using them is 12.12.46.1
